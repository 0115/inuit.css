# {{ page.title }}

Hey there! Thanks for your interest in [inuit.css](http://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css).
I’ve set up this little blog in order to share more in-depth, detailed tips,
tutorials, update information and more… If you use inuit.css, or are considering
it, hopefully this little site will aid you on your journey.

If there’s a particular topic you’d like to see covered, or you’d like a better
writeup about a certain object, then [fire me a tweet](http://twitter.com/inuitcss)
and I’ll look at getting something written up.

This site will keep evolving and improving, but for now this is my <i>MVP</i>
(I’ll be in the valley soon…) and it _should_ cover all necessary bases. Watch
this space!

Cheers,  
<i>Harry</i>
