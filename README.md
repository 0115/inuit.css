inuit.css is a powerful little framework designed for _serious_ developers.

It is a Sass based, Object Oriented framework that is full of objects and abstractions. inuit.css provides little-to-no design which means no undoing things, no deleting CSS and no adhering to other peoples’ design decisions.

inuit.css is ideally suited to designers who want to focus on the creative and not code, and developers who understand the need for abstraction and an OO approach.

inuit.css gives you design patterns, not design decisions. It features nestable, fluid grids, a double-stranded heading hierarchy, sprites, buttons and a lot, _lot_ more.


**Use inuit.css if:**

* You need a powerful library of objects and abstractions.
* You understand/appreciate the value of OO code and the need to scalability and reuse.
* You are a confident/competent developer comfortable with OOCSS and Sass, as well as familiarity with OO principles.

**Do not use inuit.css if:**

* You don’t have Sass installed.
* You need a framework that supplies design (I’d recommend [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for that).
