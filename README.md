# The inuit.css blog

This `gh-pages` is a simple Jekyll blog which should satisfy two goals:

1. Share more in-depth infor, tutorials and tips about the inuit.css framework
2. Demonstrate the optimal implementation of the framework

If you would like a particular topic covered on the blog, please feel free to
[tweet at me](http://twitter.com/inuitcss) and suggest it.
