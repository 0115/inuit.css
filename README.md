inuit.css is a powerful little framework designed for _serious_ developers.

It is a Sass based, Object Oriented framework that is full of objects and abstractions. inuit.css provides little-to-no design which means no undoing things, no deleting CSS and no adhering to other peoples’ design decisions.

inuit.css is ideally suited to designers who want to focus on the creative and not code, and developers who understand the need for abstraction and an OO approach.

inuit.css gives you design patterns, not design decisions. It features nestable, fluid grids, a double-stranded heading hierarchy, sprites, buttons and a lot, _lot_ more.

inuit.css is the most powerful little framework out there, and it’s ready to go!
